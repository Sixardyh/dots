## Changes

Started to use a patched fonts. Includes glyphs from fontawesome, devicons, etc. Transitioned to using icons in some of my configurations.

Added a floating bind to my i3 that floats and centers a window. Useful for when I'm writing notes or just don't need the full screen realestate when using only one window.

Configured the terminal within emacs. Now has 256 colors and uses my colorscheme. Would like to figure out a way to support bold text though.

Restructured and reformatted some of the major config files. Still not perfect (especially .emacs), but have to start somewhere.

Removed my gtk changes, as well as firefox configuration. Both were rarely used because they weren't terribly functional.

## TODO

* Update zathura or change to a new PDF reader
* Configure an IRC client (weechat/irssi)
* Stop using neofetch and move to my own script
