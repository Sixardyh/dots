### Goals

My last setup was a mess caused by experimentation, poor structural organization, and an unending amount of dependencies. Since changes had to made I kept a couple goals in mind.

+ Maintainability
+ Essential
+ Configurable

### Changes

For the most part I've been able to follow these guidelines. The largest changes have been, cutting a bar altogether. In it's stead I use zsh now instead of bash, which includes both the time and battery life. Using firefox over chrome for easy themeing with ![.userChrome](.mozilla/firefox/chrome/userChrome.css). Unrelated I've started using emacs over vim for essentially just org-mode and have added ![.emacs](.emacs) to the repo (For brave eyes only).

Another major change is how I handle the repo itself. Cut all the third-party handlers and add files as necessary. This is only possible as I have cut down the files I personally configure.

Basic i3 configuration has stayed mostly the same and I'm happy it's in a place where I no longer need to maintain it.
