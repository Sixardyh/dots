## Description

### Goals

My last setup was a mess caused by experimentation, poor structural organization, and an unending amount of dependencies. Since changes had to made I kept a couple goals in mind.

+ Maintainability
+ Essential
+ Configurable

### Changes

For the most part I've been able to follow these guidelines and it has resulted in a few large changes.

+ The largest change has been cutting a bar altogether. In it's stead I use zsh now over bash, and have configured a theme that includes both the current time and battery life.
+ Using firefox over chrome for easy themeing with ![.userChrome](.mozilla/firefox/chrome/userChrome.css).
+ I've started using emacs over vim for essentially just org-mode and have added ![.emacs](.emacs) to the repo (For brave eyes only).
+ How I handle the repo itself. Cut all the third-party handlers and add files as necessary. This is only possible as I have cut down the files I personally configure.

Basic i3 configuration has stayed mostly the same and I'm happy it's in a place where I no longer need to maintain it.
